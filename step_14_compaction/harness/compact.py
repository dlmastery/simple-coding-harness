"""Stage 14 - the compaction agent (video 37:52).

"When the number of tokens reaches 85% of the total context length, we're
going to reduce it to 35%." Not by dropping the oldest messages - "that's
going to break the KV cache" - but by compaction: "we summarize everything
that has happened in the session, a summary of the things that we are about
to delete from the messages array."

A second agent with one job and no tools writes that handoff note. The note
is folded into the system prompt: "we kept the compaction string at the
start of the system prompt", and because the transcript then has to fill
from 35% back to 85% before the next compaction, the prefix stays the same
in between.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are compacting the transcript of a coding session. The session is out of
context window. Write the handoff note that lets a fresh agent pick the work up
without re-reading anything.

Use these sections, in this order. Skip any that would be empty.

## Goal
What the user asked for. Quote them where the exact wording matters.

## What happened
Decisions taken and the reasoning behind them. Include approaches that were
tried and abandoned, and why - those are the expensive lessons, and an agent
without them will try the same dead end again.

## Files
Every file touched: path, and what changed in it.

## State
What works, what is broken, what was left half-finished.

## Next
The immediate next step.

Rules:
- Be specific. Real paths, function names, error text, exact commands.
- Keep anything the user explicitly asked for, corrected, or rejected.
- Never invent progress. If something was not finished, say it was not.
- No preamble and no sign-off. Start at the first heading.
