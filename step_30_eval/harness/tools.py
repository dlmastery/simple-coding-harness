"""Step 29 - the job tools join the registry: bash_background, job_status,
job_wait and job_kill, in both TOOLS and TOOL_SCHEMAS. The task tool now
accepts a list of descriptions; its schema changed, its entry here did not.
The hook points from step 27 are unchanged.

TOOLS is what can run; TOOL_SCHEMAS is what the main agent is offered in act
mode. The browser tools are in the first and not the second: only the browse
subagent is offered them. The computer tools and the memory tools are in
both, and the MCP tools join both when their servers start.
