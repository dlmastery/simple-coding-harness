"""Step 50 - sessions, turns and stored events: the server keeps the log.

Stage 8 wrote the transcript to a JSONL file; step 44 replayed it. TrueForge
stores every session, turn and event on the server. `list_sessions`,
`list_turns` and `list_events` read that store. `replay` prints a finished
turn from its stored events through the same `ThreadPrinter` the live stream
used. `reconnect` is step 34's recovery: look the turn up, subscribe to it
if it is still running, or replay it if it has finished.
