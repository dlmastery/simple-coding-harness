# Tools: the helpers you build, and their contracts

Two helpers, and a contract that keeps the verifier blind: its input is rows and a profile.

## The runtime you build (shared by every tool)

No script is shipped. Every tool below is a contract; you implement it once, on first use,
under `runs/<pack name>/helpers/` (Python with scikit-learn is the natural choice - the CSV
and the sklearn built-ins are named in the problem's `intent.md`; any language that can read a
table and fit these three models is fine) and run it through your Bash tool from this
lesson's directory. Reuse a helper that exists; do not rewrite it. Every tool prints one JSON
object and exits 0 even when it refuses: a refusal is `{"error": "..."}` (or `refused` on one
item) that you read, never a crash you retry.

- **Paths.** `<pack>` is the skill directory (`.claude/skills/<pack name>`); `<task>` is the
  problem's directory under `../tasks/`, whose `intent.md` front matter gives `name`, `target`,
  `metric`, `budget_fits`, `models`, `data`, `role`. One arm of one problem lives in
  `runs/<pack name>/<task name>/<arm>/` - `<arm>` is `memory` or `control` (a lesson may name
  others), with `-s<seed>` appended when the seed is not 0.
- **State.** `state.json` in the arm directory:
  `{"arm", "seed", "problem", "n_fits": 24, "fits_used": 0, "frozen": false, "test_scored": 0, "test_score": null, "test_recipe": null, "memory": "on" | "off" | "frozen"}`,
  written with `json.dump(..., indent=1)` so the freeze is the literal text `"frozen": true`
  (the lesson's hook greps `runs/` for it before it lets a `score_test` command run).
- **Trace.** `traces.jsonl` next to it, append-only, one JSON object per line: a fit row
  `{"t": n, "arm", "seed", "problem", "recipe", "val_score", "error"}` and event rows
  `{"event": "open" | "FREEZE" | "score_test" | "scorecard" | "write_card" | "propose" | "apply" | "gate" | "rollback", ...}`
  (`scorecard` is the scorecard tool's own event; `write_card` is the verifier's and appears only when a
  card was written). Never rewrite or delete a line.
- **Data.** `data.kind: csv` reads `data.path` relative to the series root (`..` from this
  lesson); `kind: sklearn` is `sklearn.datasets.load_<name>()` as a frame with the feature
  names and an integer `target`; `kind: synthetic` is
  `sklearn.datasets.make_classification(**params)` with the parameters listed in the front
  matter (`random_state` included), columns `x0..`, integer `target`. Non-numeric columns are
  strings with `"missing"` for NaN; the target is an int.
- **Profile.** `{"n_rows", "n_features"` (columns minus the target)`, "n_classes", "imbalance"`
  (the share of the rarest class, 3 decimals)`, "has_categorical"` (0 / 1)`}` over the whole table.
- **Split.** `order = numpy.random.default_rng(seed).permutation(n_rows)`; train = the first
  55 %, val = the next 15 %, private = the next 10 %, test = the last 20 % (cuts at
  `int(n * 0.55)`, `int(n * 0.70)`, `int(n * 0.80)`). The same seed gives the same rows on
  every machine. Only `score_test` may read the test part; only `private_score` the private part.
- **Recipe.** Exactly `{"model", "hyper", "scale", "encode", "class_weight"}` with values from
  `schema.json -> fields` (`hyper` from the model's own list; the middle value is the default:
  logreg 1, rf 16, hgb 0.1). Pipeline: `ColumnTransformer(..., sparse_threshold=0)` (dense
  output: the boosting model takes no sparse matrix) with `StandardScaler` (scale `yes`)
  or passthrough on the numeric columns and `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore")` (encode
  `onehot`) or `OrdinalEncoder(handle_unknown="use_encoded_value", unknown_value=-1)` on the
  categorical ones, then `LogisticRegression(C=hyper, max_iter=2000)` |
  `RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=40, max_depth=hyper, random_state=0)` |
  `HistGradientBoostingClassifier(learning_rate=hyper, max_iter=40, max_bins=64, random_state=0)`,
  with `class_weight="balanced"` or `None`. Metric `roc_auc` = ROC-AUC of the positive-class
  probability; `roc_auc_ovr_macro` = one-vs-rest macro ROC-AUC over `predict_proba`. Round
  `val_score` to 4 decimals; silence scikit-learn's warnings (a convergence warning is not an
  error). A fit that raises is a result too - `val_score` null, `error` `"<Type>: <message>"` -
  and it still counts against the budget.
- **Two mirrors, one pack.** Every file a tool changes inside a pack (`memory.json`,
  `SKILL.md`, `schema.json`, `roles/`, ...) changes in `.claude/skills/<pack name>/` and in
  `.agents/skills/<pack name>/` alike; `write_card`, `apply`, `gate`, `rollback` and
  `skill_memory` write both.

## Allowed

- `read_traces(pack, task, scope="problem" | "all", tally=False, of="memory")` - the fit rows of the `<of>` arm of this problem (or of every problem the pack has run, under `scope=all`) as `{recipe, val_score, error}` plus the profile, and nothing else: no messages, no reasoning, no test score. With `tally`: every pair of rows whose recipes differ in exactly one field (two models each at their middle hyper value differ in `model` only) - the higher `val_score` is a win for its value of that field and a loss for the other; a pair with one errored side marks the erroring value `errored`; print `wins`, `losses`, `errored` per `(field, value)` and `cards_by_rule`, the cards the verifier's rule makes of them.
- `write_card(pack, task, as, cards)` - refuse unless `as` is the verifier pack (`"error": "only the verifier writes cards"`); refuse when the task's `role` is `exam` or the memory arm's state says memory `frozen` (`"error": "memory frozen"`); refuse a card with any key beyond `if`, `then`, `evidence`, `counter`, an `if.key` outside the five profile keys, an `if.op` outside `> < >= <= ==`, a `then.field` outside the five recipe fields, `then` without exactly one of `prefer` / `forbid`, or whose serialised text contains `test` or `intent`. Merge into `<pack>/memory.json` (both mirrors): a card with the same `if` and `then` adds its `evidence` and `counter` to the one on disk, any other is appended; a merged card whose `counter * 2 >= evidence` is `demoted`. Append `{"event": "write_card", "as", "n", "new", "demoted"}` to the memory arm's trace and print those counts.

## Forbidden

- fit_recipe, score_test, save_model, load_splits - the verifier never fits and never touches the test split
- read_memory - the cards are in the actor pack's memory.json, which write_card merges into
